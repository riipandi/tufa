Tufa Authenticator is a free, secure and open source app to manage your
2-step verification tokens for your online services.

<b>Encryption</b>
All of your one-time passwords are stored in a vault. If you choose
to set a password, which is highly recommended, the vault will be encrypted
using AES-256. If someone with malicious intent gets a hold of the vault file,
itâ€™s impossible for them to retrieve the contents without knowing the password.

<b>Biometric unlock</b>
Entering your password each time you need access to a
one-time password can be cumbersome. Fortunately, you can also enable
biometric unlock if your device has a biometrics sensor.

<b>Compatibility</b>
Tufa supports the HOTP and TOTP algorithms. These two algorithms are
industry-standard and widely supported, making Tufa compatible with
thousands of services. Some examples are: Google, GitHub, Dropbox, Facebook
and Instagram.

It is also compatible with Google Authenticator. Any website that shows a QR
code for Google Authenticator also works with Tufa.

<b>Groups</b>
Have a lot of one-time passwords? Add them to custom groups for easier
access. Personal, Work and Social can each get their own group.

<b>Backups</b>
To make sure you will never lose access to your online accounts Tufa
Authenticator supports exporting your vault which you can import onto a new
device. Tufa Authenticator also allows you to import AndOTP and FreeOTP
databases so switching to Tufa is made easier for you.
